this data set needs to  be cleaned and it's not reallt that good 
so my 
Step 0- Get data 
Got this data from randome kaggle datasets 
Step-1 
Data ingestion/ Processing 
so bascially before i load this data, i will clean this data and see what can i do at my best 
so so so so 
this is batch processing data becuase it's not really like real time data 
now thinking baout that 
I am only going to use python sciprt to do that
